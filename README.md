The GameAnalytics API iOS Wrapper is designed to send game event data to the GameAnalytics service for processing and visualization. By collecting data from players playing your game you will be able to identify bugs and balance issues, track purchases, and determine how the players really play your game.

The code for the GameAnalytics API iOS Wrapper is open source - feel free to create your own fork, or use the code to develop your own wrapper.

## GameAnalytics Full Documentation

You can find the [full documentation](http://support.gameanalytics.com/forums) on the Game Analytics website for wrappers, RESTful API, as well as information about how to collect useful data for your game.

## GameAnalytics Website

The GameAnalytics website can be found [here](http://www.gameanalytics.com/).
To start using the iOS API Wrapper you will have to create an account on the website and add your game.


##Requirements

- iOS 5 or later
- ARC
- XCode 4.4 is required for auto-synthesis.

##Installation

The best and easiest way is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the best way to manage library dependencies in Objective-C projects.
See the ["Getting Started"](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) guide for more information.

If you haven't already, you need to install [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
In a terminal, type the following commands:

	$ sudo gem install cocoapods
	$ pod setup

With CocoaPods installed create a file called Podfile next to your project with the following contents:

```ruby
platform :ios, '5.0'

pod "GA-iOS-SDK"
```

If you already have a Podfile, just add `pod "GA-iOS-SDK"` to the end of it.
Type pod install into your terminal.
An Xcode Workspace file will be generated next to your project â€” use it instead of xcodeproj.

### Alternatives

Not using CocoaPods?
You can install [static lib](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-iOS-SDK/blob/master/StaticLibInstallation.md) then.

##Usage

Add the following line into your pre-compiled header file (`<projectname>_Prefix.pch`)

    #import "GameAnalytics.h"

when using CocoaPods add following line instead

    #import <GA-iOS-SDK/GameAnalytics.h>

In your application delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, add the following line to set your Game keys and Secret keys:

    [GameAnalytics setGameKey:@"__CHANGE_ME__" secretKey:@"__CHANGE_ME__" build:@"__CHANGE_ME__"];

Go to [GameAnalytic](http://www.gameanalytics.com) to register your game and get the game- and secret-key.

There are four different types of events to log: user, design, business, quality.
Each of these categories have different purposes, accept different values, and have certain required fields.
Check the [full documentation](http://support.gameanalytics.com/forums) for more details.
Add these method calls to your code to register every occurrence of the events.

###User data

Used to tracking demographic information about individual users (players).
Log User data examples:

    [GameAnalytics logUserDataWithParams:@{@"gender" : @"M", @"birth_year" : @1981, @"friend_count" : @100}];

    [GameAnalytics logUserDataWithGender:@"M"
                               birthYear:@1981
                             friendCount:@100];

    [GameAnalytics logUserDataWithGender:@"M"
                               birthYear:@1981
                             friendCount:@100

    						   withParams:@{@"area" : @"Level 1", @"x" : @1.0f, @"y" : @1.0f, @"z" : @1.0f, @"value" : @1.0f}];

    [GameAnalytics logGameDesignDataEvent:@"PickedUpAmmo:Shotgun"
                                    value:@1.0f
                                     area:@"Level 1"
